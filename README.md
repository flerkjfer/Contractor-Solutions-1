We utilize Flask, a python web framework, along with Render for live deployment. 

The folder, "templates," holds all site/html relevant code. 
app.py holds critical routing code and SQL code. 
test_crud.py also holds useful tests.

Other files are primariliy for deployment purposes or are protected db files. 

run "python3 app.py" on the terminal to run locally if desired
